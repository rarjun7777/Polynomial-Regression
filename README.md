Performed Polynomial Regression on Position_Salaries dataset . It predicts salaries based on position and level

# STEPS IN POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION 

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Training the Linear Regression model on the whole dataset

-> Training the Polynomial Regression model on the whole dataset

-> Visualising the Linear Regression results

-> Visualising the Polynomial Regression results

-> Visualising the Polynomial Regression results (for higher resolution and smoother curve)

-> Predicting a new result with Linear Regression

-> Predicting a new result with Polynomial Regression
